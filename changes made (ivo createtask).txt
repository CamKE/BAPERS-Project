- changed department1 from int to string: this is because it is a 2 character string in the database (char(2), CR for copy room, PD for packaging department, etc.)
- swapped the position of shelf_slot in the list of fields (relative to its actual position in the database table 'task')
- inserted the deparments into my database (you need to run the script i give you for everything to work)
- added a switch case to associate the departments name with its code: department name needs to be converted into its code to be inserted (as the fk field is the code)
- changed 
        int Department_department_code = departmentNewTaskDD.getSelectedIndex(); 
to 
		String Department_department_code = (String) departmentNewTaskDD.getSelectedItem();
		
the index of the dropdown means nothing if you just insert it into the table. you want the actual 
value they selected, not the index (the position that data is in the dropdown list)

- changed shelf slot value. should just be a integer (maybe between 1 and 100? thats what i done in this casse)
i made the dropdown display values 1 - 100 (made a function in the controller to display them, can manipulate it 
in the future to hide taken slots).

-         int shelf_slot = (int) shelfSlotTaskDD.getSelectedItem();
shelf slots an int, so we store it like that. using index doesnt make sense in this case either
        int duration_min = (int) durationNewTaskMinsDD.getSelectedItem();
same thing.
- you put the 'hrs' in the dropdown. why??? put it as text on the page instead, makes no sense repeated in the dd

-         duration_min += duration_hours*60;
added the hours to the total time (you didnt use the hours before)
